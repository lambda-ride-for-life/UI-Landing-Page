                    <h2>Our Goal</h2>

                    <p>Our goal is to provide access to medical facilities for women in Uganda via local drivers so that they may attain the necessities to have safe deliveries of healthy babies. To accomplish this goal, we have put together a well thought out website that facilitates a link between mothers and experienced drivers. This website creates a space where mothers can search for drivers by location and request a ride to find the fastest way to a medical center. We are immensely grateful to those who have and/or will help us to accomplish this goal, one ride at a time.</p>
